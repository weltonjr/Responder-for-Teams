# Responder (by Welton) - Microsoft Teams App

Years have passed and we yet do not have an answer button on desktop teams, only mobile.

To resolve these problems, I created a Teams plugin that make this, is not the best solution, but is a solution.

I have not tried to publish on the store, I think Microsoft will not allow me, but if you think otherwise, message me.

## How To Use

You will need to sideload the Add-in on your company Teams.

## Bot key

You can use my free bot key

### Free bot service disclaimer

All messages sent to the public service will not be persisted, analyzed or anything else, they will only be returned to the teams via the Azure Bot Service (only way I found to implement this, if you know another way, message me or submit a Pull Request).

I cannot guarantee that the service will be online all the time, if the usage surpasses my monthly budget, I will shutdown the bot for the month (I am only a single dev making 13k per year)

The Azure Bot Framework and Azure Functions is a Microsoft service, for privacy information about these services read they privacy policy.
